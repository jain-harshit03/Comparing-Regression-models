# Regression Model Comparison

This repository contains code and analysis for comparing different regression models on a dataset. The goal is to evaluate the performance of various regression algorithms and provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Model Performance Comparison

The table below summarizes the performance metrics (MSE, MAE, R^2) of different regression models on the dataset:

| Model              | MSE           | MAE       | R^2       |
|--------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Linear Regression  | 2313.71       | 37.28     | 0.147     |
| Decision Tree      | 1074.00       | 16.58     | 0.604     |
| Random Forest      | 1064.70       | 16.52     | 0.608     |
| Gradient Boosting  | 1364.91       | 24.04     | 0.497     |
| Ridge Regression   | 2313.70       | 37.28     | 0.147     |
| MLP Regression     | 2233.31       | 36.32     | 0.177     |

## Theoretical Comparison

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - Theory: Assumes a linear relationship between features and target variable. Simple and interpretable.
   - Strengths: Easy to implement, computationally efficient.
   - Weaknesses: Limited to linear relationships, sensitive to outliers.

2. **Decision Tree**:
   - Theory: Builds tree-like structures to make decisions based on feature splits.
   - Strengths: Captures nonlinear relationships, interpretable.
   - Weaknesses: Prone to overfitting, lack of smoothness.

3. **Random Forest**:
   - Theory: Ensemble of decision trees trained on bootstrapped samples of data.
   - Strengths: Reduces overfitting compared to decision trees, robust to outliers.
   - Weaknesses: Less interpretable than decision trees, slower training time.

4. **Gradient Boosting**:
   - Theory: Builds an ensemble of weak learners (typically decision trees) sequentially.
   - Strengths: Provides high predictive accuracy, handles complex relationships.
   - Weaknesses: May overfit, computationally intensive.

5. **Ridge Regression**:
   - Theory: Linear regression with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
   - Strengths: Reduces overfitting, stabilizes coefficients.
   - Weaknesses: Assumes all features are relevant.

6. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Regression**:
   - Theory: Neural network with multiple layers of nodes.
   - Strengths: Captures complex nonlinear relationships, scalable.
   - Weaknesses: Requires tuning of hyperparameters, computationally intensive.

## Conclusion

Based on the model performance comparison and theoretical analysis, the **Random Forest Regression** model appears to be the most suitable choice for this dataset. It achieves the lowest MSE and MAE, indicating better predictive performance, while also maintaining a high R^2 score. Random Forests are robust to outliers, handle high-dimensional data well, and are less prone to overfitting compared to decision trees. Therefore, they are recommended for this regression task.
